Introduction

.. todo:: 

   - include introduction text

     - pragmatic approach; instead of trying to normalize and standardize each and every available field of all collections, OCD makes basic textual searching for objects across collections possible
     - the goal is not to provide an exhaustive data mapping between collection, but to give a developer access to a simple API that provides all kinds of cultural heritage data.
     - the API follows a common design (REST) and document format (JSON) known by many developers.
     - on a per collection basis, more advanced questions can be asked
     - for each indexed object, the original data can easily be accessed via the API. A developer can decided to parse the original data himself if he wants to obtain very specific data that is not directly incorporated in the indexed item.

Features

* All original data is kept and remains accessible in it's original form.
